# Ads Theory

## Dynamic Ad Insertion(DAI)

## Burned-in Ads
Burned-in ads refers to ads that are permanently embedded directly into the video content itself. These ads become an integral part of the video and cannot be easily removed or skipped by viewers. 
Burned-In Ads are ads that are pre-generated and inserted directly into the stream, using an asset capture tool like OBS.

## Linear Ads
Linear ads refer to advertisements that are shown within a linear media stream, such as a television broadcast or a live streaming session. 
These ads are inserted into scheduled commercial breaks during a program. They follow a predetermined sequence and timing, similar to traditional TV commercials. 
Linear ads are broadcast to all viewers watching the program simultaneously and are not individually targeted based on user preferences.
