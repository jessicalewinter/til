# High- and low-level languages
A *low-level* language is machine-oriented. Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must be performed to carry out a task.

*High-level* languages are programming languages that are designed to allow humans to write computer programs and interact with a computer system without having to have specific knowledge of the processor or hardware that the program will run on.
