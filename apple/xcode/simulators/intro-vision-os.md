## VisionOS

To be able to run your app on the VisionOS simulator, you need to have the following requirements:
- Apple Silicon
- Xcode Xcode 15 beta 2 or higher 
- visionOS SDK beta or higher

Go to General, and check if the Apple Vision option appears on the supported destinations.
If your app supports the iPad version, the Apple Vision destination will use the iPad version, because the iPad version has priority over the iPhone destination. If your app only supports iPhone as destination, the Apple Vision will use the iPhone one.
