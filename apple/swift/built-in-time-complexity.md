# Built-in methods

## `count`
To check whether a collection is empty, use its isEmpty property instead of comparing count to zero. Unless the collection guarantees random-access performance, calculating count can be an O(n) operation.

### Complexity
Array conforms to RandomAccessCollection, so the complexity O(1)
String does not conforms to RandomAccessCollection, so the complexity is O(n)

## `isEmpty`
When you need to check whether your collection is empty, use the isEmpty property instead of checking that the count property is equal to zero. For collections that donâ€™t conform to RandomAccessCollection, accessing the count property iterates through the elements of the collection.

### Complexity
O(1)
