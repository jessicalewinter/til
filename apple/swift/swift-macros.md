# Swift Macros

## Introduction

Macros is a hand piece of code that lets you use it to avoid repetition. Macros modifies your code on compile time.

Both input and output are checked to ensure that they have the right types. If you face a error, the compiler treats it as a compilation error.

Swift has two types of macros
- Freestanding macros does not need to be attached to a declaration
- Attacheed macros moify the declaration that they belong to.
