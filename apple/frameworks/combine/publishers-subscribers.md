# Publishers and Subscribers
To create a basic publisher in Combine, you can transform any value type using the `.publisher`, that will convert this type to a publisher that emits elements when start its subscription

```swift
let fibonacciArray = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8].publisher
```

The type of this publisher it is `Publishers.Sequence<[Int], Never>`

Publishers is a enum that contains Combine's built-in publishers.
Every publisher in Combine has an Output and a Failure.

On our example, the subscribers of a sequence publisher will receive Int objects when subscring to it. This sequence publisher receives as a failure the Never type, this means it will never emit error events, only successfull events.



## Subscribing

### receiveValue shorthand
`sink` comes with a shorthand for publishers that have Never as their Failure type. It allows us to omit the receiveCompletion closure:
[1, 2, 3].publisher.sink(receiveValue: { value in
  print("received a value: \(value)")
})
This shorthand version of sink only works for publishers that never fail. If your publisher has the possibility of failing, you need to add the `receiveCompletion` closure.

### assign built-in subscriber
The assign subscriber is also defined on Publisher and it allows us to directly assign publisher values to a property on an object:

```swift
var contact = Contact()
["lastName"].publisher.assign(to: \.lastName, on: contact)
```

The preceding code creates a publisher that emits strings. We use assign to directly assign every published string from this publisher to the user objectâ€™s email property. This can be very convenient but it comes with some rules. The assign method requires that the key path that we want to assign values to is a ReferenceWriteableKeyPath. This pretty much means that the key path must belong to a class. And for this to work, we need to expose the target property to the Objective-C runtime using an @objc annotation. 
 Contact class:

```swift
class Contact {
  @objc var lastName = "default"
}
```
