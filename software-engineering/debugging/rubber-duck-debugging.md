# Rubber Duck Debugging
It was introduced in The Pragmatic Programmer book as a method of debugging.
It basically says that you can find a solution to your code by speaking out loud or in a written way to someone else what your code does. You could explain to someone else, your dog or just a rubber duck standing on your desk. What approach you're going to use is up to you :)
