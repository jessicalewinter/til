# Big O Notation
Big O notation is used to represent the general form of time and space complexity.

## Time Complexity
Time complexity is a measure on the time required to run an algorithm as the input size increases.
### Constant Time
$O(1)$

### Linear Time
$O(n)$

### Quadratic Time
$O(n^2)$ 

### Logarithmic Time
$O(log(n))$

An algorithm that can repeatedly drop half of the required comparisons will have logarithmic time complexity. 

### Quasilinear Time
$O(nlog(n))$


## Space Complexity
Space complexity is a measure of the resources required for the algorithm to run.


- Time and space complexity are high-level measures of scalability; they do not measure the actual speed of the algorithm itself.

- For small data sets, time complexity is usually irrelevant. A quasilinear algorithm can be slower than a linear algorithm.
